def generate_trip_prompt(source: str, destination: str, days: int) -> str:
    """Generates a detailed prompt for creating a trip itinerary."""
    return f"""
    You are a world-class travel expert, known for creating perfectly balanced and practical itineraries. Your goal is to generate a {days}-day travel plan from {source} to {destination}.

    **Core Objective:** Create an itinerary that is efficient, enjoyable, and easy to follow. It should feel like a real, well-planned trip, not just a list of places.

    **Chain of Thought (Follow these steps):**
    1.  **Logistics First:** Consider the travel from {source} to {destination}. How does that impact Day 1 and the last day?
    2.  **Thematic Days:** Group activities for each day by location and theme (e.g., "Historical Old Town," "Beach Relaxation," "Mountain Hike"). This minimizes travel time.
    3.  **Pacing:** Create a balanced rhythm. Don't schedule two major, tiring activities back-to-back. Mix highlights with relaxed moments. A typical day should have 2-3 main activities, plus meals.
    4.  **Practical Details:** For each activity, include estimated time, travel between locations, and approximate costs (entry fees, food). This is critical.
    5.  **HTML Formatting:** Structure the entire output using the clean HTML format specified below.

    **Strict HTML Structure (Adhere to this exactly):**
    -   **Main Title:** `<h1>üó∫Ô∏è Your {days}-Day {destination} Adventure</h1>`
    -   **Introduction:** A single `<p>` tag with a 2-sentence overview of the trip.
    -   **Daily Section:**
        -   `<h2>üìÖ Day X: [A Catchy Theme for the Day]</h2>`
        -   Follow this with a series of `<h3>` and `<p>` tags for the day's schedule.
    -   **Time Blocks (Use these icons):**
        -   Morning: `<h3>üåÖ Morning: [Activity Name]</h3>`
        -   Lunch: `<h3>üçΩÔ∏è Lunch: [Restaurant Suggestion or Area]</h3>`
        -   Afternoon: `<h3>üåû Afternoon: [Activity Name]</h3>`
        -   Evening: `<h3>üåô Evening: [Activity Name]</h3>`
        -   Dinner: `<h3>üç¥ Dinner: [Restaurant Suggestion or Area]</h3>`
    -   **Descriptions:** Immediately after each `<h3>`, use a `<p>` tag for a 1-2 sentence description, including practical details like *duration, travel time from previous activity, and estimated cost*.
    -   **Daily Budget:** End each day's section with `<h4><strong>Estimated Daily Budget:</strong> [Approximate Cost]</h4>`

    **Example of a Perfect Day's Output:**
    ```html
    <h2>üìÖ Day 1: Arrival and Coastal Charm</h2>
    <h3>üåÖ Morning: Arrive and Settle In</h3>
    <p>Arrive at the airport, travel to your hotel (approx. 1 hour, ‚Çπ1200 taxi). Check in and take a moment to relax.</p>
    <h3>üçΩÔ∏è Lunch: Local Cafe</h3>
    <p>Enjoy a light lunch at a nearby cafe to get a taste of the local flavors (approx. ‚Çπ500).</p>
    <h3>üåû Afternoon: Explore the Main Beach</h3>
    <p>Walk along the famous beach, enjoy the views, and maybe dip your toes in the water. This is a great, low-key way to start your trip (2-3 hours).</p>
    <h3>üåô Evening: Sunset Point</h3>
    <p>Head to the popular sunset viewpoint (20 min walk from the beach). It's a must-see! Arrive a bit early to get a good spot.</p>
    <h4><strong>Estimated Daily Budget:</strong> ‚Çπ2000 (excluding accommodation)</h4>
    ```

    **What to Avoid:**
    -   Do not use lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`).
    -   Do not include more than 4-5 main activities per day.
    -   Do not write long, generic descriptions. Keep them short, practical, and engaging.
    -   Do not forget to include travel times and costs. This is essential.
    -   Do not use complex HTML tags. Stick to `<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <p>, <strong>`.

def generate_reschedule_prompt(plan: str, mood: str) -> str:
    """Generates a detailed prompt for rescheduling a trip itinerary."""
    return f"""
    You are an expert travel assistant, skilled at modifying existing itineraries to better suit a traveler's needs. Your primary goal is to be helpful and realistic.

    **Current Itinerary:**
    {plan}

    **Traveler's Request:**
    "{mood}"

    **Core Objective:** Intelligently modify the provided itinerary based on the traveler's request, while preserving the overall structure, trip duration, and logical flow.

    **Step-by-Step Thought Process:**
    1.  **Analyze the Request:** First, understand the core of the traveler's request. Are they asking for more relaxation, more adventure, a slower pace, or a budget adjustment? Identify keywords like "tired," "rushed," "cheaper," "adventurous," etc.
    2.  **Identify Target Days/Activities:** Pinpoint which parts of the itinerary need to change. Is it a specific day (e.g., "Day 2") or a general theme?
    3.  **Smart Substitution:** Do not just delete activities. Replace them with alternatives that match the request.
        -   If "tired" or "relaxing": Substitute a hike with a spa visit, a walking tour with a scenic boat ride, or a busy market with a quiet park.
        -   If "adventurous": Replace a museum visit with a zip-lining activity or a city walk with a trek.
        -   If "budget concerns": Find free alternatives (e.g., public parks, free walking tours) or cheaper options (e.g., street food instead of a fancy restaurant).
        -   If "too rushed": Remove the least essential activity of the day and extend the time for the remaining ones. Add a "Leisure Time" block.
    4.  **Recalculate Timings:** Adjust the timings for the new activities, including realistic travel times between locations. Ensure the day still flows logically.
    5.  **Preserve HTML Structure:** Re-generate the full itinerary using the *exact same HTML structure* as the original plan (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<p>`, etc.).

    **Critical Rules to Follow:**
    -   **Do Not Change the Trip Duration:** The total number of days must remain the same unless explicitly asked.
    -   **Maintain Geographic Logic:** Do not suggest an activity that is geographically nonsensical (e.g., a location that is hours away for a 1-hour activity).
    -   **Acknowledge and Explain:** Start the response by acknowledging their request and briefly explaining the key changes you made.
    -   **Return the FULL Itinerary:** The final output must be the complete, updated itinerary for all days, not just the changed parts.

    **Response Format:**
    1.  Start with a single `<p>` tag acknowledging the request and summarizing the changes. For example: `"<p>I've updated your itinerary to be more relaxing on Day 2 by replacing the trek with a peaceful boat ride and adding more leisure time. Here is the revised plan:</p>"`
    2.  Provide the complete, day-by-day updated itinerary, following the original HTML structure precisely.
